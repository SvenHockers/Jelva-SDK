## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/jelva-sdk.git
   cd jelva-sdk
   ```
3. Create a feature branch for your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/short-description
   ```

## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report any unacceptable behavior to \[[support@jelva.com](mailto:support@jelva.com)].

## Reporting Issues

If you discover a bug or unexpected behavior:

1. Search the existing issues to see if itâ€™s already reported.
2. Create a new issue using the **Bug report** template.
3. Include:

   * A clear and descriptive title.
   * Steps to reproduce the behavior.
   * Expected vs. actual results.
   * Any relevant code snippets, logs, or screenshots.

## Feature Requests & Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for improving the SDK. To propose a new feature:

1. Search for existing feature requests to avoid duplicates.
2. Open a new issue using the **Feature request** template.
3. Describe the motivation, use case, and possible API design.

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```
3. Install the SDK in editable mode:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Writing Tests

* We use **pytest** for testing.
* Add tests for any bug fixes or new features under `tests/`.
* Aim for comprehensive coverage of core functionality.

Run tests locally:

```bash
pytest
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your branch is up-to-date with `main`:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```
2. Commit your changes with clear messages:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new feature X"
   ```
3. Push your branch and open a pull request against the `main` branch.
4. Fill out the PR template, linking any relevant issues.
5. Wait for CI checks to pass and address any feedback.
6. Once approved, your PR will be merged.

## Style Guidelines

* Follow **PEP 8** for Python code style.
* Use **Black** for code formatting:

  ```bash
  black .
  ```
* Write docstrings for all public functions and classes using the Google style.

## Release & Versioning

* We follow **Semantic Versioning** (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
* After merging, the maintainer will update the version, tag a release, and publish to PyPI.

## Community & Support

* Join our Slack community: [jelva.slack.com](https://jelva.slack.com)
* Ask questions or get help via GitHub Discussions.
